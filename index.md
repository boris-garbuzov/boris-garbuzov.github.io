I recently defended my PhD in statistics at the University of Toronto,
specializing in time series. My previous degreesâ€¯reflect my other interests -
finance, economics and mathematics. My practical experience includes Excel, VBA,
R, SAS, Python and Java. Currently, I teach subjects related to data science in
York University on part-time basis, and I work on stress testing in an insurance company.
