I am currently pursuing PhD in statistics at the University of Toronto,
specializing in time series.
My previous degrees reflect my other interests - finance, economics and
mathematics. My practical experience includes Java, R, SAS and Python.
Defending my thesis soon, I hope to work in finance or data-related industry.
