**Project 1. Simultaneous  confidence band.** [Github repository](https://github.com/statistics101/nscb2)
- In my first project of statistics Ph.D.,
I implemented Zhao's confidence band for autocorrelation.
The coverage frequency matched the target confidence level better with
sample size increase.

**Project 2. Newey-West vs threshold LRV estimate** [Github repository](https://github.com/statistics101/nw-vs-t)
- In my second project of statistics Ph.D.,
I experimentally compared the threshold LRV estimate to the industry
standard Newey-West.
In my experimental cases the threshold estimator converged faster.

**Project 4. Analysis of observational data on myorelaxant comparison**
- This project comprises analysis of the experiment,
designed and conducted by a hospital.
For two years the hospital collected the observational data on surgeries of
120 patients with 60 parameter measurements on each.
The purpose was to compare the recovery time assisted by bridion against the
one assisted by neostigmine and the spontaneous recovery in context of two
relaxants â€“ rocuronium and pipecuronium. The parameters included the main
demographic and health state variables with the primary focus on the recovery
time
